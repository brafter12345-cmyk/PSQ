# Outstanding Items — Phishield Scanner

**Last updated**: 2026-05-16
**Owner**: SML Consulting (engineering) + Phishield UMA (ops)
**Authoritative source** for items pending across the scanner project.
Consolidates open items from gap analysis SCN-* entries, memory files,
and session-level decisions. Update this file whenever a new
outstanding item lands.

**File pair:**
- `OUTSTANDING.md` (this file) is the live working version — edit here.
- `OUTSTANDING.docx` is a polished read-only snapshot for easy reading.
  Regenerate after each edit with `py -3 tooling/generate_outstanding_docx.py`
  (from the `security_scanner/` directory). The script applies Phishield
  branding and formats tables for printable / shareable output.

## 1. Hosting / infrastructure

| Item | Status | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cloudflare / Hetzner proxy for `phishield.com/scanner-info`** | Pending hosting-company action | Hosting team | Tuesday 2026-05-19 (WordPress → HTML cutover). Handoff doc at `docs/scanner_info_proxy_setup.md`. Options: static copy (simplest), nginx reverse-proxy (cleanest), Cloudflare layer (long-term). |
| **User-Agent flip back to canonical `phishield.com/scanner-info`** | Blocked by proxy above | Engineering | After hosting team confirms `phishield.com/scanner-info` returns 200. Single-line change in `http_client.py` USER_AGENT constant. |
| **GCP / Vertex AI migration of scanner backend** | Future | Phishield ops + engineering | No fixed date. Adds protected environment + LLM-augmented analysis. When this lands: re-run scanner-info IP-range description; update User-Agent host; migrate `scans.db` from SQLite-on-Render to Cloud SQL Postgres. |
| **Eventual move to Hetzner self-hosted** | Future-future | TBD | After GCP/Vertex experience accumulated. |

## 2. External API budget (Phase 2 unblockers)

| API | Current tier | Required tier for 4,000-cohort | Estimated monthly cost | Action by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shodan | Free `oss` (0 query credits — confirmed via `/api-info` 2026-05-29) | **Freelancer ($69/mo, 10,000 query credits)** unlocks search + origin cert-search. One-time **Membership (~$49, 100 credits/mo)** is a low-volume stopgap. | ~$69/mo (≈R1,300) if per-IP vuln data stays on free InternetDB and only origin cert-search spends credits (~1 credit/scan). Higher only if per-IP `/shodan/host/{ip}` lookups are also moved to the paid API. | Before 1 July 2026 — **also gates origin IP discovery (see §5, item 4c), which is a scanner-breaking RDP false-negative on CDN-fronted targets** |
| SecurityTrails | Free (100/month; history endpoint works on current key — confirmed 2026-05-29, NOT paid-gated) | Paid tier for sustained usage | Similar order of magnitude | Before 1 July 2026 |
| VirusTotal | Free (4/min, 500/day) | No upgrade needed | — | n/a |
| IntelX | **CRITICAL.** Returning data in the 2026-05-29 live test (300 results: 260 leak + 40 paste mentions, with per-record dates) — the "expired 2026-04-08" note is stale, the configured key currently works. It is now **load-bearing**: the 4th signal (active forum/dump circulation + recency dates) in the **Credential Exposure Correlation**. | Confirm a sustainable IntelX subscription OR equivalent (Snusbase / LeakCheck Pro / SpyCloud) — must persist, not lapse | TBD | **CRITICAL — before shipping live.** Credential correlation degrades gracefully without it ("monitoring pending") but loses the active-circulation signal + its main recency source. |
| HIBP, Hudson Rock, OSV.dev | Free unlimited | No upgrade needed | — | n/a |

### Shodan origin cert-search — how to make it live

Origin IP discovery (`origin_discovery.py`) is **already wired and deployed**.
It works in two stages and the paid stage **auto-activates the moment a paid
key is in place — no code change or redeploy of logic is needed**:

1. **Free stage (live now):** `/shodan/host/count` returns how many internet
   hosts present the target's TLS certificate. Surfaced in the report as the
   "Origin IP Discovery" card. When that count exceeds the origins we confirm
   via DNS history, the report flags a likely **undiscovered exposed origin**.
2. **Paid stage (pending key):** `/shodan/host/search` returns the actual
   origin IPs. On the free `oss` plan it returns HTTP 403 and we fall back to
   count-only. On a paid plan it returns the IPs, which are then TLS-cert
   verified and scanned like any other origin.

**Go-live steps:**
1. Buy a Shodan plan — **Freelancer ($69/mo)** recommended (10,000 query
   credits/mo); or one-time **Membership (~$49)** for low volume. Buy it on
   the Shodan account **whose API key is already set in Render** (so credits
   attach to that key), or buy on a new account and update the key in step 2.
2. Set / confirm `SHODAN_API_KEY` in the Render environment for the scanner
   service (Render → service → Environment). No code change required.
3. (Optional) verify with `GET https://api.shodan.io/api-info?key=...` —
   `query_credits` should be > 0 and `plan` should read `dev`/`member`/etc.,
   not `oss`.
4. Next scan of a CDN-fronted domain will retrieve + verify + scan the real
   origin IPs automatically; the "Origin IP Discovery" card switches from a
   count-only hint to listing the verified origins.

Budget note: keep per-IP vulnerability data on the **free InternetDB** path
(current default) so Shodan credits are spent only on the ~1-credit-per-scan
cert-search. Moving `/shodan/host/{ip}` per-IP lookups onto the paid API is
the larger credit consumer (~1 credit per discovered IP per scan) and is a
separate decision.

### IntelX (free tier) — current state + Wednesday testing

Confirmed 2026-05-29: the configured IntelX key **works** (the "trial expired"
note was stale). **Correction (2026-05-31, verified live via
`/authenticate/info`):** the free tier's search cap is **`CreditMax = 50`** for
`/intelligent/search` (NOT ~500 — that was a wrong code comment). `CreditReset`
is present so credits **do replenish** (recurring, not one-off), but the cap is
only **~50 search credits per cycle** (1 credit/scan), and max 3 concurrent
searches. So it is usable only for a **handful of ad-hoc scans per cycle** —
**far too small for the 4,000-client cohort or sustained broker volume.** A
sustainable paid replacement is therefore the real requirement. Avoid burning
credits on test scans (`skip_intelx:true` for smoke tests).

- **Action (before 2026-06-03 calibration test):** add `INTELX_API_KEY` to
  **Render** (it's currently set locally but NOT on Render — that's why prod
  has no IntelX/forum signal while local does). This makes the credential
  correlation's signal-4 active on prod for Wednesday's supply-chain
  calibration run.
- **Still seek a sustainable replacement** (Snusbase / LeakCheck Pro /
  SpyCloud) for the cohort-scale + always-on case; the free tier can remain a
  fallback for ad-hoc use. The credential-correlation circulation slot is
  provider-agnostic, so swapping is a checker change, not a correlation rewrite.

## 3. Peer benchmarking rollout (SCN-028)

| Phase | Status | Start date | Source tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 — public reference seed pool | **Live** (bi-weekly via `tooling/benchmark_runner.py`) | 2026-05-16 onwards | `benchmark_pool` |
| Phase 2 — lower-tier-upsell cohort (~4,000 clients) | Pending | 1 July 2026 → ~Feb 2027 (6-9 months at ~25-30/day) | `lower_tier_upsell` |
| Phase 3 — broker opt-in via scan form checkbox | Future | When opt-in plumbing is added; no fixed date | `client_optin` |

**Phase 2 prerequisites** (must complete before 1 July):
- [ ] Export 4,000-client list to CSV (`domain, industry, sub_industry, annual_revenue_zar` columns)
- [ ] API tier upgrades (see section 2)
- [ ] Daily cron / Render scheduled job invoking `py -3 tooling/benchmark_runner.py --source lower_tier_upsell --input-csv ... --limit 25`
- [ ] Phase 2 upsell workflow definition (how to deliver PDFs to brokers / clients)

## 4. Deferred-to-continuous-monitoring track (SCN-026)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Probe-cache SQLite-backed implementation | Interface defined in `http_client.ProbeCache`; default `_NullProbeCache` no-op. Real implementation lands with continuous-monitoring scheduler. |
| Continuous-monitoring scheduler | Open. Estimated 3-4 week build. Requires probe cache + per-tenant scheduling + delta-finding detection + alert-on-change pipeline. |

## 5. Open accuracy items (gap analysis roadmap)

Carried over from v9 / v10 gap analyses. Not blocking but worth flagging:

| Phase | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 4b | CMS admin path detection (dynamic from tech stack) | Open |
| 4c | CDN origin IP leakage / origin discovery | **Partial — implemented (`origin_discovery.py`, 2026-05-29):** SecurityTrails historical-DNS candidates + TLS cert-match verification live; verified origins scanned, candidates surfaced. Free Shodan cert-host count hint live. **Full Shodan cert-search IP retrieval pending paid key (see §2 go-live).** Also: RDP exposure now reconciled across all discovered IPs, not just the apex (was a false-negative on CDN-fronted targets). |
| 4d | MFA presence on VPN login pages | Open |
| 4c-ii | **Infrastructure-infection / C2-beaconing signal** (reinsurer "Infrastructure Infections — Malicious Connection Attempt" card). Distinct from credential/infostealer: it flags *org servers/hosts* observed connecting to malicious infra. We partially cover via DNSBL (reputation/blacklist), but lack infection-type + days-observed granularity. Would need a threat-intel feed (Spamhaus CSS/XBL, GreyNoise, abuse.ch Feodo). **Attribution caveat:** the reinsurer's example IP `152.111.191.48` reverse-resolves to `download.kalahari.com` (Kalahari merged into Takealot 2014) — a legacy/related-brand IP not in takealot.com's scope, so it would only surface via related-domain (S-1) discovery + cert-verification. Same reassigned-IP risk as the RDP/origin case. | Open |
| 4e | WAF rate limiting / bot protection detection | Open |
| 4f | DNSSEC validation chain | Open |
| 4h | Exploit Window narrative enhancement | Open |
| 5a | Bug bounty programme detection (HackerOne / Bugcrowd) | Open |
| 5f | retire.js CVE cross-reference | Open |
| 5i-T1 | AI Threat Readiness Tier 1 (externally observable) | Glasswing done; rest open |
| 5i-T2 | AI Threat Readiness Tier 2 (self-reported) | Open |

## 6. Architectural follow-ups (low priority)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Refactor remaining checkers through `HTTP` singleton | `privacy_compliance`, `info_disclosure`, `exposed_admin` done. `payment_security`, `vpn_remote`, `security_policy`, `fraudulent_domains`, and single-request checkers (SSL, WAF, etc.) still use direct `requests.get`. WAF tracker only sees burst probers; widening this gives full WAF visibility. ~3 hrs work, low risk. |
| Enforcement-discount % calibration per regulator | Statutory maxima used everywhere in cat stack. Expected-loss view uses heuristic. Compliance officer should set per-regulator discount %. |
| Civil exposure quantification (POPIA s99 / common-law delict) | Currently qualitative disclosure only. Quantification requires internal-contract data. |
| Tail recalibration with empirical SA cat data | 5× PERT upper bound on `mc_total_breach` is conservative. Calibrate against SABRIC + CISA + IBM SA-specific incident-type data when available. |
| WAF coverage-loading constant calibration (SCN-029) | `K_TAIL=1.20` in `_calculate_zar` sets how aggressively the catastrophe tail widens per unit of lost scan coverage. Heuristic — calibrate against rescan deltas (blinded scan vs allow-listed rescan of the same target) once continuous monitoring provides paired observations. Only the ZAR path is loaded; the dead USD path is not. |
| Bias correction on `lower_tier_upsell` benchmark cohort | Cohort may not be SA median; pool composition disclosed in report. Future: source-class weighting in percentile calculation. |
| GPD tail fit MLE upgrade (currently method-of-moments + pure numpy) | scipy.stats.genpareto provides MLE fit but adds dependency. Defer until scipy is acceptable on Render. |
| **Credential-risk scoring calibration** (ticket, NOT done) | Two tweaks to `CredentialRiskClassifier`, both **calibration-gated** (empirical anchors + sign-off, per the scoring-change rule): (1) the IntelX paste/dark-web deductions are **per-mention and uncapped** (40 pastes → −120, floored at 0) — can out-deduct Hudson Rock's flat −50 in the raw 0-100 score even though HR sets the higher *level*; add a cap. (2) **Date-gate the HR CRITICAL** so a *stale* infostealer infection (old `last_compromised`) doesn't auto-force CRITICAL — use the new `days_since_compromise`. The Credential Exposure Correlation (reporting) already does this date-anchoring; this would align the *score* with it. |

## 7. Documentation / artifacts

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| User Manual docx regeneration | `py -3 generate_manual.py` — now a **thin orchestrator** that assembles `manual_parts/part1-6` (each `build(doc)`); writes `Phishield_Cyber_Risk_Scanner_User_Manual.docx`. **Edit content in `manual_parts/`** (not the orchestrator). Helpers live in `manual_parts/helpers.py` (aliased by top-level `manual_helpers.py`); part1 uses `set_helpers()` injection, parts 2-6 import directly. The pre-2026-05-18 monolith is retired but preserved in git history (commit before the cutover) if ever needed. |
| Gap Analysis v10 regeneration | Auto-regenerated via `node generators/gen_gap_v10.cjs` (or root `gen_gap_v10.cjs` if not moved). Outputs to main project path: `C:/.../security_scanner/Phishield_Scanner_Gap_Analysis_v10.docx` |
| FAIR Model Gap Analysis (legacy) | `generators/generate_gap_analysis.cjs` produces `Phishield_FAIR_Model_Gap_Analysis.docx`. Pre-v10 artifact; check if still needed before next regeneration |
| Sensitivity analysis docs | `tooling/sensitivity/sensitivity_analysis*.py` + JSONs + `generators/gen_sensitivity_doc.cjs`. Pre-v10 calibration analysis; verify relevance before next regeneration |
| Legacy gap analysis v6/v7/v8 docx | Archived at `docs/archive/`. Kept for historical reference; not regenerated |

## 8. Document quality rules (cross-project)

Hard rules for all client-facing PDF / docx outputs live in
`C:\Users\sarel\.claude\projects\C--Users-sarel-Desktop-Sarel-Local-Only\memory\feedback_document_quality.md`.
Audit every output against the 12 rules before regeneration. Pre-build
audit gate is rule #0.
